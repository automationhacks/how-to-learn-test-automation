# SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Static application security testing (SAST) is a set of technologies designed to analyze application source code, byte code and binaries for coding and design conditions that are indicative of security vulnerabilities. 
SAST solutions analyze an application from the “inside out” in a non-running state.
